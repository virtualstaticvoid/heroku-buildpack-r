#
# NOTES:
#
# R presents some unique challenges when used on Heroku
#
# The buildpack includes all the binaries required for R to run however,
# application authors need to include additional packages which need to be built
# in order to be included in the slug compilation. This means a build environment
# is needed at slug compilation time.
#
# R is built (by default) with the path prefix of "/usr".
# (See https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installation for
# details on the prefix configure options.)
#
# This is a problem on Heroku, since /usr is locked down and cannot be modified.
#
# In the previous version of the R buildpack, R was built from source using "/app" for
# the prefix. While this worked, there were several issues with resolution of dependencies
# for which there were many "hacks" employed. E.g. overriding LD_LIBRARY_PATH and other
# environment variables, using symlinks, and changing paths in ldconfig files etc.
#
# Further complexity is created by the way Heroku slug compilation works, in that the BUILD_DIR
# is not same path as that in the final deployment, so further hacks were required to move files
# around, to and from /app and BUILD_DIR. This caused issues with symlinks and since the files for
# the slug are compressed in a tar.gz file, the "untarring" caused further issues.
#
# Worse still, is that version mismatches between components emerged, which caused segfaults
# and other hard to solve problems.
#
# The solution? Try to use "official" packaged R versions, installed to default locations.
#
# Yet another version of the buildpack used the Apt buildpack, so that apt-get could be used to
# install R and it's dependencies, but this approach proved to be fraught with similar path issues.
#
# Finally, (this version) uses a chroot method, which provides a sandbox in which to install R
# correctly, and all it's dependencies, with all symlinks and paths intact.
#
# A small complication to this approach is that since Heroku cannot run chroot under sudo, a fake chroot
# has to be used to allow for chroot to work under the standard user.
#
# The upside of this approach are:
#
#  * Less hacks applied, thus less details of R need to be known by the buildpack.
#  * More maintainable when newer R versions need to be supported.
#  * More stable, since dependencies and pathings are standard.
#  * No segfaults or other hard to track down errors.
#
# The downsides of this approach are:
#
#  * Slightly larger slug of ~110MB,
#
#  * Under certain circumstances, an "ugly" command line to run R is used
#    E.g. `fakechroot fakeroot chroot /app/.root /usr/bin/R ... --no-save`
#    There are however wrapper scripts for R and Rscript which take care of this.
#
#  * Your application files are in /app, which need to be symlinked into the chroot, which
#    can cause issues if the R `base::normalizePath(..., mustWork=TRUE)` method is used.
#    A "method replacement hack" in `Rprofile.site` solves this issue.
#
#  * Some third party libraries for R cannot be used, since R needs to run in the chroot, and
#    the library is not executed in the chroot, making R inaccessible.
#    RServe is the most viable interface to R in this case. See the node.js example application.
